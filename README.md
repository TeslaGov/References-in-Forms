# Reference Script

This script will add HTML references to relevant text column.

Make sure you have your dataset in the same working directory as the script. 

In addition, the source column names must follow this format: 'Source_i' where i is 1, 2, 3, etc. This column must contain the links to the sources in PiX.

You must also have source reference columns that follow this name format: 'Reference_i' where i is 1, 2, 3, etc. Each column will contain the reference of the associated source that matches the following format: 'Date, Source Name, Title'

For example: 
Source_1
'pixtoday.net/article/file/'

Reference_1
'10 October 2023. PiX. Title'
